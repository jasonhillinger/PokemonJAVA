A Pokemon like combat system

The Pokemon like combat system should use an Object-Oriented approach for all Pokemon. Each Trainer should have
6 Pokemon that they get to chose at the beginning of the program (Have a few default ones ready to chose).

Once both trainers pick their four Pokemons, they will engage in combat with each other. Both players will cast
their first chose Pokemon to battle and the Pokemon with the higher speed stat will get to go first.

The first trainer to have all Pokemon feint loses.
